<h1>Intro</h1>
    <p> 
        This is a group project created to highlight the amazing things AI allows us to do. We will discuss how things like chatbots use AI to improve and smoothen customer experience. You will also gain an understanding of how AI can help solve problems in fields such as medicine, where a program can take the symptoms of a patient, and then decide what the best treatment is.
    </p>

    <p>
            After reading these pages, you should hopefully begin to truly understand how important and useful AI has become in our day-to-day lives. It is from this that many of you will ask questions such as <strong> "Are robots becoming too advanced?" </strong> and <strong>"Will AI turn on us one day?"</strong>. These are very valid queries that are discussed and hopefully answered on the final page of our website.

<h2 class="p-2"> A Glance at AI's Power </h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
        The videos on the right really demonstrate the power of artificial intelligence in modern society. The robot's movements all look so human like that it almost makes you empathise with it. Obviously, this situation is likely quite scripted, but in the future, the technology will keep getting pushed further and further. The question for the next generation of engineers and designers is as follows: <strong> Can you ensure this technology is used sensibly and safely? </strong>
