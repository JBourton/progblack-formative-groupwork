i. Interest of content
I would give the content 'Very Good', it is quite interesting but can be a bit 'wordy'. For it to be higher, I would like to see images or videos to help break up the text. The homepage worked propely for me, but none of the images on the other pages worked properly for me, so probably take a look at that.

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
The homepage and AI safety page have consistent visuals with the page margin. But the other 2 pages dont have this margin. The navbar is consistent across the whole webiste, as is the fonts/headings and the author details. I would give it a 'Good' rating, because it is inconsitent in places, but also the visual quality of the pages could be improved too.

iii. Quality of written presentation
The text content is very well written, so I would give it an "Excellent" rating. The use of bullet points and also paragraphs makes the pages feel 'bloggy', which is fine, but I would suggest to make sure everything is written in the same casual style.

iv. Validity of HTML
Using a google chrome extension html validator, there are a total of 17, 52, 2 and 7 'Warnings' on each relativep page. Therefore, I have to rate this section as 'Good'. For the most part, there are a few warnings and nothing critical; but the 2nd page (applications in customer service) has 52 warnings, which seems like a lot.

v. Evidence of collaboration
The insights page on github says that JBourton made the most commits with 18, followed by JamesS-D with 9, and joewrightlaprugne with 5 commits. Most commits were made today (04/11), with the second most on Monday (31/10). This tells me that there was collaboration since the task was started on Friday (28/10) - well done. It was sort of completed at the last minute with regards to the medical page. Author details were made by other users. In general, I would rate this section as "Excellent".
