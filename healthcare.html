    <h1>Programming (Black) project: Artificial Intelligence in Medicine</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Since the late 20th century, artificial intelligence has been revolutionising and advancing the field of medicine and healthcare, with the potential to save countless lives in the future. AI has a number of applications in the field of medicine, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnosis</li>
        <li>Drug development</li>
        <li>Robotic surgery</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Using AI to diagnose disease</h2>
    <p>In recent years, artificial intelligence has been used to interpret results of medical imaging such as MRIs and CT scans, and determine whether or not a given scan indicates disease. Pre-existing images from patients known to have a certain condition are fed into a deep learning algorithm which picks out the key features which indicate disease. Eventually, this algorithm learns to pick out these features on its own, with increasing accuracy. In 2019, studies found that AI was on par with human specialists when it comes to medical diagnosis.  A clinical trial in the United States also found that an algorithm was able to correctly classify brain tumour tissues at the same rate as human physicians.</p>
    <h2>The role of AI in drug discovery</h2>
    <p>Another application of artificial intelligence is in drug discovery. AI models can work out the relationship between the molecular structure of a compound and its impact on the body, allowing them to determine the efficacy of a proposed new drug, and whether or not it will have any harmful side effects. AI will have a monumental impact in this field, as currently 90% of drug candidates fail clinical trials, and AI will be instrumental in reducing this number and increasing the speed at which new lifesaving drugs are discovered.</p>
    <h2>The role of AI and surgical robots in surgery</h2>
    <p>Robots, assisted by AI, are now used to help surgeons carry out precise surgeries more effectively. Devices track the surgeon's movements and feed them into a machine learning algorithm, which over time learns the surgeon's precise movements. This data is then used by surgical robots to help the surgeon with the precise positioning of their tools, eliminating human error caused by shaky hands or stress.</p>
