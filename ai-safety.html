    <h1>AI Safety</h1>
    <p>
        Currently, AI is a field that is constantly being talked about, both by Computer Scientists 
        and members of the general public. This is not just because of the potential that AI will have 
        in the future; it is also because AI is currently impacting our lives in many ways. For example,
        you have used Face ID to unlock your phone today; that's made possible because of AI. You may
        also have spent 6 hours on social media, scrolling away aimlessly; that would be because the AI 
        algorithm on social media has been designed to keep you captivated by the content you see on 
        your feed. As you can see, AI is very much present and making a signficant impact on our lives.

        However, there is a possibility that when we embrance AI quickly, without thinking about any of
        the potential safety implications involved, we could end up with catastrophic, unintended results.
        This article aims to bring to the readers attention potential dangers of AI and what we can do to
        prevent them.
