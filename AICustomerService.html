    <h2>The application of AI in customer service</h2>
    <h5>In what ways is AI being used for customer service?</h5>
    <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a tool which has been prominently used over the years to promote valuable cutomer experience. There are many different examples of ways AI is used in customer service, which includes <em>(but is not limited to):</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Chatbots</li>
        <li>Self-Service</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        <li>AI Training</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Chatbots</em> are computer software designed with the ability to imitate human interaction, normally though text chats, but this can also be through voice and other forms of communication). This is done in order to assist businesses with communicating with customers. For example, a chatbot may be the first point of contact if a user has an issue with a service the business may provide. A chatbot may then refer a customer onto a real employee if the chatbot itself is unable to help the user.</p>
    <p><em>Self Service</em> software allows customers to be able to complete operations without the need for human help. For example, it may help someone naviagte a website or complete a purchase without human help.</p>
    <p><em>Natural language processing</em> gives a computer the ability to understand text and spoken word in much the same way that human beings can. As will be explained, this can be used in other areas of technology, including chatbots and emails.</p> 
    <p><em>AI Training</em> is when a computer is able to train certain groups of people (particularly employees) in a way that can take into account previous data on training processes. It can also simulate almost any situation that could arise during situations concerned with customer service.</p> 
    <p><em>Machine learning</em> (in this context) is a mechanism for analysisng large data streams and providing useful conclusions based on this large amount of data. It also allows other parts of AI described to improve over time by analysing data associated with them.</p>
    <p>When these applications of AI for customer service are allowed to interact with eachother, they play a crucial role in modern business. </p>

    <h5>How are these applications of AI helping businesses?</h5>
    <p>While obviously being used for the purpose of helping customers, AI is primarily beneficial from the perspective of the business itself. This is because AI makes the task of running a business much smoother, and can help in many specific areas. One of the main benefits of AI for businesses is that customers are more likely to continue engaging with the business in the future due to all the benefits AI brings for them (e.g. making the buying process easier). This obviously results in a valuable larger customer base, but also encourages the business to invest further in AI. Another notable benefit of AI is that it can work 24/7 without the need to be managed by human employees, particularly when considering natural language processing capabilities (allowing AI to understand customers from many different backgrounds). This can save huge amounts of money for a business, as not nearly as many people need to be employed for customer service roles (due to it largely being automated by the AI which is cheaper to maintain than hiring customer service representatives). In this way, AI can streamline the workflow of a company by handling general issues that don’t require human knowledge and attention. This also has the benefit of humans not having to carry out the most mundane tasks (as these can be handled by the AI). This helps avoid employee burnout and promotes a healthy employee lifestyle. It also doesn’t lead to employees having nothing to do, as in the event that AI (e.g. a chatbot) cannot solve an issue, it can easily transfer users to a human employee.</p>
    <p>AI also yields many benefits for businesses in regards to analytics. Machine learning allows companies to analyse and assess large amounts of data which can be used to improve their services for customers. For example, machine learning can be used to assess the volume of certain issues that customers have, which in turn makes it easier for the company to implement features that reduce this volume. AI can be applied to many situations like this in customer service, which not only benefits customers, but aids the business itself with making decisions. </p>
    <p>Finally, AI training is being used more and more by businesses in order to streamline the training of employees in customer service. AI can provide (in part) ongoing training for human customer service managers to help develop their skills. With the help of machine learning, these AI trainers can become quite advanced, offering training that relates specifically to the company they are being used for. This allows for different relevant situations to be simulated, which can be used to assess an employees ability to solve these problems. </p>
    <p>As a whole, while AI obviously improves user experience in customer service, the real value of AI lies in the benefits it can offer for the actual businesses behind that customer service. </p>
