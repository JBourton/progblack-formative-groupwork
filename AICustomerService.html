    <h2>The application of AI in customer service</h2>
    <h5>In what ways is AI being used for customer service?</h5>
    <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a tool which has been a prominent part of promoting effective cutomer experience for many years. There are many different examples of ways AI is used in customer service, which includes <em>(but is not limited to):</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Chatbots</li>
        <li>Self-Service</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        <li>AI Training</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Chatbots</strong> are computer software designed with the ability to imitate human interaction, normally though text chats, but this can also be through voice and other forms of communication). This is done in order to assist businesses with communicating with customers. For example, a chatbot may be the first point of contact if a user has an issue with a service the business may provide. <strong>Self Service</strong> software allows customers to be able to complete operations without the need for human help. For example, it may help someone naviagte a website or complete a purchase without human help. <strong>Natural language processing</strong> gives a computer the ability to understand text and spoken word in much the same way that human beings can. <strong>AI Training</strong> is when a computer is able to train certain groups of people (particularly employees) in a way that can take into account previous data on training processes. It can also simulate almost any situation that could arise during situations concerned with customer service. <strong>Machine learning</strong> (in this context) is a mechanism for analysisng large data streams and providing useful conclusions based on this large amount of data. It also allows other parts of AI described to improve over time by analysing data associated with them.
