    <h2>The application of AI in customer service</h2>
    <h5>In what ways is AI being used for customer service?</h5>
    <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a tool which has been prominently used over the years to promote valuable cutomer experience. There are many different examples of ways AI is used in customer service, which includes <em>(but is not limited to):</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Chatbots</li>
        <li>Self-Service</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        <li>AI Training</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Chatbots</em> are computer software designed with the ability to imitate human interaction, normally though text chats, but this can also be through voice and other forms of communication). This is done in order to assist businesses with communicating with customers. For example, a chatbot may be the first point of contact if a user has an issue with a service the business may provide. A chatbot may then refer a customer onto a real employee if the chatbot itself is unable to help the user.</p>
    <p><em>Self Service</em> software allows customers to be able to complete operations without the need for human help. For example, it may help someone naviagte a website or complete a purchase without human help.</p>
    <p><em>Natural language processing</em> gives a computer the ability to understand text and spoken word in much the same way that human beings can. As will be explained, this can be used in other areas of technology, including chatbots and emails.</p> 
    <p><em>AI Training</em> is when a computer is able to train certain groups of people (particularly employees) in a way that can take into account previous data on training processes. It can also simulate almost any situation that could arise during situations concerned with customer service.</p> 
    <p><em>Machine learning</em> (in this context) is a mechanism for analysisng large data streams and providing useful conclusions based on this large amount of data. It also allows other parts of AI described to improve over time by analysing data associated with them.</p>
    <p>When these applications of AI for customer service are allowed to interact with eachother, they play a crucial role in modern business. </p>
    <h5>How are these applications of AI enhancing user experience?</h5>
    <p>The many applications of Artificial Intelligence can be utilized by businesses in order to improve the users experience with customer service. As mentioned above, chatbots are a prominent aspect of AI used in customer service, and these can be particularly helpful for users when combined with natural language processing software capabilities. These can undertake various activities based on information typed/spoken by the customer, such as reminding them to check out, reminding them to leave a review and answering any queries they have (that are common queries for customers). Relating to this, self service software powered by AI can help customers with many things, such as solving specific issues they have, completing their purchases and navigating a website. Both chatbots and self service software can vastly improve the user experience for customers, particularly if they struggle with technology in general. In turn, this encourages them to complete any purchases and  revisit the site in the future. </p>
    <p>Another crucial use of AI to promote user experience in customer service relates to personalized content based on machine learning. Machine learning enables businesses to analyse huge amounts of data on their customers, including (for example) what products they have viewed (and for how long/how many times), what time they tend to buy things and purchase history. With the aid of AI in the form of machine learning, businesses are able to help customers find things they desire based on this data they have collected on them. This can significantly enhance the user experience in customer service, as users are more likely to find things they are actively looking for, or things they would like to find but hadn’t previously thought about. In this way, machine learning allows businesses to personalise the user experience for their customers, which in general, leads to better customer service. </p>
    <p>Clearly, AI is very useful for improving the user experience for customer service, particularly when these different areas of AI work in tandem with each other and when managed appropriately. But, as I will now discuss, there are perhaps even more benefits for the businesses themselves.</p>
    <h5>How are these applications of AI helping businesses?</h5>
    <p>While obviously being used for the purpose of helping customers, AI is primarily beneficial from the perspective of the business itself. This is because AI makes the task of running a business much smoother, and can help in many specific areas. One of the main benefits of AI for businesses is that customers are more likely to continue engaging with the business in the future due to all the benefits AI brings for them (e.g. making the buying process easier). This obviously results in a valuable larger customer base, but also encourages the business to invest further in AI. Another notable benefit of AI is that it can work 24/7 without the need to be managed by human employees, particularly when considering natural language processing capabilities (allowing AI to understand customers from many different backgrounds). This can save huge amounts of money for a business, as not nearly as many people need to be employed for customer service roles (due to it largely being automated by the AI which is cheaper to maintain than hiring customer service representatives). In this way, AI can streamline the workflow of a company by handling general issues that don’t require human knowledge and attention. This also has the benefit of humans not having to carry out the most mundane tasks (as these can be handled by the AI). This helps avoid employee burnout and promotes a healthy employee lifestyle. It also doesn’t lead to employees having nothing to do, as in the event that AI (e.g. a chatbot) cannot solve an issue, it can easily transfer users to a human employee.</p>
    <p>AI also yields many benefits for businesses in regards to analytics. Machine learning allows companies to analyse and assess large amounts of data which can be used to improve their services for customers. For example, machine learning can be used to assess the volume of certain issues that customers have, which in turn makes it easier for the company to implement features that reduce this volume. AI can be applied to many situations like this in customer service, which not only benefits customers, but aids the business itself with making decisions. </p>
    <p>Finally, AI training is being used more and more by businesses in order to streamline the training of employees in customer service. AI can provide (in part) ongoing training for human customer service managers to help develop their skills. With the help of machine learning, these AI trainers can become quite advanced, offering training that relates specifically to the company they are being used for. This allows for different relevant situations to be simulated, which can be used to assess an employees ability to solve these problems. </p>
    <p>As a whole, while AI obviously improves user experience in customer service, the real value of AI lies in the benefits it can offer for the actual businesses behind that customer service. </p>
